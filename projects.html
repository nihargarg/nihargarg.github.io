        <h2>Smart Bin Remover <i class="fa fa-trash"></i></h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in college, I have been a part of many teams and worked on multiple projects. In my Senior Engineering Design class, my team and I designed an innovative, fully autonomous robot that can attach to the three most common types of waste bins and deliver the attached bin to the desired pick up location on trash day. I headed the programming of the robot using an Arduino microcontroller and led the integration and testing of "smart" technologies to remove all user interaction. The Smart Bin Remover project placed top 7 at the Mechanical Engineering Innovation Competition at Purdue University.

        <h2>Project LiT <i class="material-icons">watch</i></h2>
        <p>
          Project LiT is a wearable solution to drunk driving. It uses an OLED panel that notifies you of your blood alcohol content and an RGB LED strip that alerts everyone around you if have crossed the legal limit, so your friends can stop you from driving or stop themselves from getting in the car with you. My contributions included implementing the engineering design process and writing code to integrate all the electrical components using an Arduino microcontroller. Project LiT won top 5 for best hardware hack at the HackIllinois Hackathon at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

        <h2>Project Green Light <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i></h2>
        <p>
          Project Green Light is a social initiative which helps people connect more easily. It provides you information such as table availability and status through data collected from the Arduino devices. My contributions included collaborating on the design and build of the product, developing the product all the way from ideation to completion and working on the presentation and documentation for the project. We truly believe this product will revolutionize your social interactions. Project Green Light won top 5 for best hack at the BoilerMake Hackathon at Purdue University.
