          As an engineering student, it was important that I got some real world experience in addition to all my coursework. To do this, I made sure to spend my summers interning for the companies not only in the US, but also internationally. I tried to get real-life experiences in as many engineering fields as possible, so I could have a better idea of what I wanted to pursue as a career. Below, I have talked about my most recent internship as this was the most relevant to what I want to do, and also talked about how I am currently problem solving as a software engineer!

        <h2>Project Management Internship</h2>
        <p>
          I have had three internships over my past three summers at Purdue University. One of my most memorable internships was during the summer of 2015, where I worked at Kaiser Aluminum in Kalamazoo, MI as an Intern Project Engineer. I was working with the Project Management team to solve problems around the plant and successfully completed 5 projects from start to finish. I designed and tested solutions which maximized ergonomics and reduced downtime. Check out my resume for more details on this internship and the other industry experiences I've had!
