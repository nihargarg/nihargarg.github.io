         As an engineering student, it was important that I got real world experience in addition to all my coursework. In order to maintain my competitiveness, I have tried to spread my professional career over various engineering fields. Due to my diverse experience through college summer internships, in the construction, oil &amp; gas and manufacturing industries, I was easily able to secure my first full-time job after graduation, in the financial software industry.

        <p>
          I now wish to pursue a role that is more in line with my field of study and offers many opportunities for personal and professional growth.

        <h2>Associate Systems Analyst</h2>
        <p>
          I worked as an Associate Systems Analyst at Charles River Development from July 2016 to November 2017.

        <h2>Project Management Internship</h2>
        <p>
          I have had three internships over my past three summers at Purdue University. My most recent and memorable internship was during the summer of 2015, where I worked at Kaiser Aluminum in Kalamazoo, MI as an Intern Project Engineer. I was working with the Plant Operations team to solve problems around the plant. My responsibilities included managing 5 captial projects and applying my knowledge of the engineering design process to successfully complete them from start to finish. I designed and tested solutions which maximized ergonomics and reduced downtime. Check out my resume for more details on this internship and the other summer internship experiences I've had!
