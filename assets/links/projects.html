          I have worked on numerous projects in classes and during hackathons, and have always tried to solve real world problems to impact the lives of everyday people through purpose driven product design. I thrive in work environments that require lots of teamwork and collaboration, and strive to set high standards through the quality of my work. I am looking to work with engineering teams to expand my technical knowledge in a practical engineering application.

          Some examples of my projects are listed below:

        <h2>Smart Bin Remover <i class="fa fa-trash"></i></h2>
        <h4>Purdue University</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in college, I have been a part of many teams and worked on multiple projects. For our Senior Design Capstone Project, my team and I designed an innovative, fully autonomous robot that can attach to the three most common types of waste bins and deliver the attached bin to the desired pick up location on trash day. First, we defined the problem we were trying to solve, then we built a prototype, tested the software and controls and evaluated the results. We repeated these steps numerous times and ended with a product that is completely different from what we imagined it. We looked at various aspects of the robot, such as ease-of-use for the end user, durability of our product and ability to integrate with the existing conditions and design parameters set by our end user which was the local Waste Management company. We also designed the charging pod and programmed the robot to find its way back to the base, where it would plug in and charge itself when not in use. I headed the programming of the robot using an Arduino microcontroller and led the integration and testing of "smart" technologies to remove all user interaction. The Smart Bin Remover project placed top 7 at the Mechanical Engineering Innovation Competition at Purdue University.

        <h2>Project LiT <i class="material-icons">watch</i></h2>
        <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign - HackIllinois Hackathon</h4>
        <p>
          Received recognition for creating one of the best hardware hacks at Hack Illinois, one of the largest University Hackathons in the country with over 1000 participants. We created an internet connected wearable breathalyzer to warn people when they are over the alcohol permissible limit for driving. It uses an OLED panel that notifies you of your blood alcohol content and an RGB LED strip that alerts everyone around you if have crossed the legal limit, so your friends can stop you from driving or stop themselves from getting in the car with you. My contributions included implementing the engineering design process and writing code to integrate all the electrical components using an Arduino microcontroller. Project LiT won top 5 for best hardware hack at the HackIllinois Hackathon at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

        <h2>Project Green Light <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i></h2>
        <h4>Purdue University - BoilerMake Hackathon</h4>
        <p>
          Project Green Light is a social initiative which helps people connect more easily. It provides you information such as table availability and status through data collected from the Arduino devices. My contributions included collaborating on the design and build of the product, developing the product all the way from ideation to completion and working on the presentation and documentation for the project. We truly believe this product will revolutionize your social interactions. Project Green Light won top 5 for best hack at the BoilerMake Hackathon at Purdue University.

        <h2>T2P2D - Toys to Physics to Design <i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i></h2>
        <h4>Purdue University - C Design Lab</h4>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to develop a framework to encourage a maker-based design mindset embedded in physics for K-12 students. <br />
          • Developed workshops for K-12 students to design simple toys and 3D print them. <br />
          • Benchmarked different open source CAD software and categorized them by ease-of-use. <br />
          • Manufactured prototypes using 3D printing technologies (Ultimaker 2, Makerbot).
        </p>

        <h2>HandiMate <i class="fas fa-draw-polygon"></i></h2>
        <h4>Purdue University - C Design Lab</h4>
        <p>
          • Created a robotics kit which enables users to construct and animate their toys using everyday craft materials. <br />
          • Proposed new and innovative uses for the product using everyday objects such as cardboard, construction paper and spoons. <br />
          • Tested and gave feedback on various constructions and promoted brainstorming among users.
        </p>

        <h2>Project BigDoc <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i></h2>
        <h4>Washington University St. Louis - ArchHacks Hackathon</h4>
        <p>
          Project BigDoc is a managed care solution that uses big data technologies to proactively prevent medical emergencies. Healthcare enterprises are currently investing a lot of money in personalized preventative care plans for people who lack access to basic healthcare due to lack of money, transportation or resources. My contributions included working on the concept generation/evaluation, creating all the content around the idea and managing the development process of the product.
