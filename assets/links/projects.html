          I have worked on numerous projects in classes and during hackathons, and have always tried to solve real world problems to impact the lives of everyday people through purpose driven product design. I thrive in work environments that require lots of teamwork and collaboration, and strive to set high standards through the quality of my work. I am looking to work with engineering teams to expand my technical knowledge in a practical engineering application.

          <h2>Smart Bin Remover <i class="fa fa-trash"></i></h2>
          <h4>Purdue University</h4>
          <h4>Oct 2015 – May 2016</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout my time in college, I have been a part of many teams and worked on multiple projects. For our Senior Design Capstone Project, my team and I designed an innovative, fully autonomous robot that can attach to the three most common types of waste bins and deliver the attached bin to the desired pick up location on trash day. First, we defined the problem we were trying to solve, then we built a prototype, tested the software and controls and evaluated the results. We repeated these steps numerous times and ended with a product that is completely different from what we imagined it. We looked at various aspects of the robot, such as ease-of-use for the end user, durability of our product and ability to integrate with the existing conditions and design parameters set by our end user which was the local Waste Management company. We also designed the charging pod and programmed the robot to find its way back to the base, where it would plug in and charge itself when not in use. I headed the programming of the robot using an Arduino microcontroller and led the integration and testing of "smart" technologies to remove all user interaction. The Smart Bin Remover project placed top 7 at the Mechanical Engineering Innovation Competition at Purdue University.

          <h2>Special Education Classroom <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i></h2>
          <h4>Princeton Engineering Services</h4>
          <h4>May 2019-Present</h4>
          <p>
            Provided engineering design services for the NYCSCA to convert an existing first floor classroom (Room 136) into a new Home Economics / Activities of Daily Living Room (ADL).  <br />
            Located in Brooklyn, K753 (also known as Aveyron Academy) has over 65 students who have been determined to be at-risk in their daily living skills for numerous reasons including autism, emotional disturbance, seizure disorders, cognitive delays or other economic or language-based difficulties. <br />
            Addressing the real-world needs of students who have been determined to be at-risk in their daily living skills for numerous reasons including autism, emotional disturbance, seizure disorders, cognitive delays or other economic or language-based difficulties, my team at Princeton Engineering Services and the NYC School Construction Authority (SCA) developed a new typology of educational space, the Home Economics/Activities of Daily Living Room (ADL). <br />
            This new typology is geared to not only allow students with disabilities to overcome various difficulties in order to succeed in school, but also help them to develop the necessary skills that will prepare them for post-secondary independence. Our design solution provides students with multi-sensory experiences that will provide practical experience for navigating and living in the community. <br />
            The project's construction cost was $490,000.

          <h2>Pool Restoration <i class="fas fa-swimmer"></i></h2>
          <h4>Princeton Engineering Services</h4>
          <h4>May 2019-Present</h4>
          <p>
            Engineering design services to the NYC School Construction Authority (SCA) for the M440 interior restoration and reconstruction of the existing defective pool foundation walls at the sub-cellar and cellar levels along with interior renovations of the adjacent pool areas, bathrooms and natatorium at the cellar level. In addition, a new elevator will be provided at the first-floor level down to the pool area for accessibility compliance. <br />
            Located in Manhattan, M440 (also known as James Baldwin School / Bayard Rustin Educational Complex) was constructed circa 1930’s. The building is located at 351 W 18th Street, and contains an approximate student population of 2,130 students, serving 09 through 12 grades. <br />
            The overall project objective is for SYSTRA to address the conditions of the existing reinforced pool plunge structure measuring 75 feet x 28 feet (96,200 gallon capacity) located at the sub-cellar level, including active water leakage through the plunge walls, and multiple cracks at the enameled brick of the pool-side finished surface, and provide accessibility for all new spaces, including the renovated Natatorium, adjacent toilets, showers, lockers, and offices. <br />
            The project's construction cost was $12,027,000.

          <h2>Project LiT <i class="material-icons">watch</i></h2>
          <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign & Major League Hacking - HackIllinois Hackathon</h4>
          <h4>Feb 2016</h4>
          <p>
            Received recognition for creating one of the best hardware hacks at Hack Illinois, one of the largest University Hackathons in the country with over 1000 participants. We created an internet connected wearable breathalyzer to warn people when they are over the alcohol permissible limit for driving. It uses an OLED panel that notifies you of your blood alcohol content and an RGB LED strip that alerts everyone around you if have crossed the legal limit, so your friends can stop you from driving or stop themselves from getting in the car with you. My contributions included implementing the engineering design process and writing code to integrate all the electrical components using an Arduino microcontroller. Project LiT won top 5 for best hardware hack at the HackIllinois Hackathon at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

          <h4>Purdue University & Major League Hacking - BoilerMake Hackathon</h4>
          <h4>Oct 2015</h4>
          <p>
            Project Green Light is a social initiative which helps people connect more easily. It provides you information such as table availability and status through data collected from the Arduino devices. My contributions included collaborating on the design and build of the product, developing the product all the way from ideation to completion and working on the presentation and documentation for the project. We truly believe this product will revolutionize your social interactions. Project Green Light won top 5 for best hack at the BoilerMake Hackathon at Purdue University.

          <h2>Project BigDoc <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i></h2>
          <h4>Washington University St. Louis & Major League Hacking - ArchHacks Hackathon</h4>
          <h4>Nov 2016</h4>
          <p>
            Project BigDoc is a managed care solution that uses big data technologies to proactively prevent medical emergencies. Healthcare enterprises are currently investing a lot of money in personalized preventative care plans for people who lack access to basic healthcare due to lack of money, transportation or resources. I managed the engineering development process of the product. Generated and evaluated all the content around the idea from the ideation phase. Designed the solution and innovated to overcome challenges and find future uses
