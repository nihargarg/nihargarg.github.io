          My diverse professional experience ranges from internships in Construction, Oil &amp; Gas and Manufacturing, to full-time roles in FinTech and Professional Services. I am an engineering leader who hopes to continue delivering products that drive customer value and company results. <br />
          Some examples of my work experience are listed below:

	        <a href="http://www.princetonengineering.services/" target="_blank"><h2>Princeton Engineering Services</h2></a>
	        <h4>Project Engineer</h4>
	        <h4>Jan 2018 – Present</h4>
	        <p>
	        	Served as the go-to engineering resource for all CIP and CTF projects with the NYC School Construction Authority (NYCSCA).
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	I have led over 25 projects (>$50 MM) for various agencies in the public sector and managed the projects through all aspects of the lifecycle, from conceptual design through project completion. I planned, delegated, monitored and maintained control of all aspects of the projects, and ensured that all projects are delivered on time, within budget and according to the project's scope of work. I supervised a multi-disciplinary team of 5 engineers and coordinated work between all trades. I understood complex project needs, provided reliable options and delivered cost-effective & energy efficient design solutions in a timely manner. I was also responsible for relationship management with the project owners, architects and contractors.
			</p>
	        <p>
        		In addition to designing Mechanical <i>(HVAC equipment - including chillers/boilers, ductwork, hydronic piping, steam piping and HVAC controls)</i> systems, I also designed Plumbing <i>(domestic cold and hot water, plumbing piping, sanitary drainage and gas)</i>, Electrical <i>(power, interior lighting, exterior lighting, data, telecommunication and distribution)</i>, Fire Alarm <i>(smoke/CO/heat detectors, digital fire alarm systems and panels)</i> and Fire Protection <i>(sprinkler and fire piping)</i> systems. Some other clients I worked with are School District of Philadelphia (SDP) and NJ DPMC. I worked on several new constructions, additions and major renovations at educational facilities, correctional facilities, multi-family residential, mixed-use and office buildings. I strongly believe in quality engineering and sustainable design and strive to improve people’s lives by engaging in inclusive design that connects our communities and sustains our environment.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	I managed all projects by following the engineering design process, where I started by finding and responding to proposals, preparing fee estimates and creating technical writeups. When the project was awarded to our firm, I performed field surveys to assess conditions existing of existing systems and prepared Scope Reports with Findings and Recommendations, Calculations and Construction Cost Estimates. Next, I worked on interdisciplinary Design Drawings in AutoCAD, typed up the Product Specifications and performed Quality Control on construction documents to ensure consistency with the project goals and to reduce cost. Throughout the process, I worked closely with my clients and responded to any concerns by the review team. I regularly performed heating and cooling load calculations and building energy modeling to determine design criteria and size system components. I am well-versed with my clients' design requirements, room planning standards and filing procedures (DOB, BCC and FDNY). I ensured the Contract Documents adhered to the applicable state and national codes and regulations, such as IBC, IMC, IFGC, NYC Building Code, NYC Mechanical Code, NYC Energy Code, ASHRAE 90.1 and NFPA-13. Moreover, I answered any RFIs, reviewed shop drawings and submittals from the contractors, and issued addendums and bulletins as necessary. Lastly, I prepared final punchlists and invoiced for the work that has been completed.
