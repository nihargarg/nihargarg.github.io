          As a Mechanical Engineering student, it was important that I got some real world experience during my time at Purdue.

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>
          I have had three internships over my past three summers at Purdue University. One of my most memorable internships was during the summer of 2015, where I worked at Kaiser Aluminum in Kalamazoo, MI as an Intern Project Engineer. I was working with the Project Management team to solve problems around the plant and successfully completed 5 projects from start to finish. I designed and tested solutions which maximized ergonomics and reduced downtime. Check out my resume for more details on this internship and the other industry experiences I've had!
