        <p>
          I have worked on numerous projects in classes and during hackathons, and have always tried to solve real world problems to impact the lives of everyday people through purpose driven product design. I thrive in work environments that require lots of teamwork and collaboration, and strive to set high standards through the quality of my work. I am looking to work with engineering teams to expand my technical knowledge in a practical engineering application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples of my projects are listed below:
        </p>

        <h2>Smart Bin Remover <i class="fa fa-trash"></i></h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in college, I have been a part of many teams and worked on multiple projects. For our Senior Design Capstone Project, my team and I designed an innovative, fully autonomous robot that can attach to the three most common types of waste bins and deliver the attached bin to the desired pick up location on trash day. I headed the programming of the robot using an Arduino microcontroller and led the integration and testing of "smart" technologies to remove all user interaction. The Smart Bin Remover project placed top 7 at the Mechanical Engineering Innovation Competition at Purdue University.

        <h2>Project LiT <i class="material-icons">watch</i></h2>
        <p>
          Project LiT is a wearable solution to drunk driving. It uses an OLED panel that notifies you of your blood alcohol content and an RGB LED strip that alerts everyone around you if have crossed the legal limit, so your friends can stop you from driving or stop themselves from getting in the car with you. My contributions included implementing the engineering design process and writing code to integrate all the electrical components using an Arduino microcontroller. Project LiT won top 5 for best hardware hack at the HackIllinois Hackathon at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

        <h2>Project Green Light <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i></h2>
        <p>
          Project Green Light is a social initiative which helps people connect more easily. It provides you information such as table availability and status through data collected from the Arduino devices. My contributions included collaborating on the design and build of the product, developing the product all the way from ideation to completion and working on the presentation and documentation for the project. We truly believe this product will revolutionize your social interactions. Project Green Light won top 5 for best hack at the BoilerMake Hackathon at Purdue University.

        <h2>T2P2D - Toys to Physics to Design <i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i></h2>
        <p>
          I spent one semester in the C Design Lab at Purdue University with Dr. Karthik Ramani and two semesters in the Applied Laser Spectroscopy Lab with Dr. Sameer Naik. At the C Design Lab, I worked on the T2P2D - Toys to Physics to Design project using modern design and 3D printing technologies. The purpose of this project was to develop a framework to encourage a maker-based design mindset embedded in physics for K-12 students, where I developed workshops for the students to design simple toys and 3D print them. I also benchmarked different open source CAD software, categorized them by ease-of-use and manufactured prototypes using 3D printing and laser cutting technologies.

        <h2>Project BigDoc <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i></h2>
        <p>
          Project BigDoc is a managed care solution that uses big data technologies to proactively prevent medical emergencies. Healthcare enterprises are currently investing a lot of money in personalized preventative care plans for people who lack access to basic healthcare due to lack of money, transportation or resources. My contributions included working on the concept generation/evaluation, creating all the content around the idea and managing the development process of the product.
